This project is a proto-type for a resume writing application. The application is unique because:

- It uses past resumes or CVs to build a career history
- It uses AI to write resume text
- It creates a custom resume for specific job descriptions

This proto-type will use a micro-services architecture based on the RedwoodJS api framework. The micro-services will be built around the primary features of the system. These features are:

- User Management
- Template Management
- Resume Creation
- Job History
